Kamura is a project containing Groovy builders and related classes for creating and processing
popular types of files that are common in day-to-day work.

"Kamura" is the MƒÅori word for carpenter.

Kamura is organised into very small modules, so that you do not need to add dependencies for what you don't need.

The modules are listed below. More details can be found in each module's own README.
