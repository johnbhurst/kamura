Notes on the examples: Where PDFBuilder works well or doesn't.

h1. Chapter 6

PdfPTableAbsolutePositions:

  table.setTotalWidth([50, 250] as float[])

instead of

  table.totalWidth = [50, 250] as float[]

Because PdfPTable also has setTotalWidth(float), Groovy cannot treat totalWidth
as a JavaBean property of type float[].

This example writes table data using writeSelectedRows() and
a PdfContentByte.  It does not use document.add(), so cannot use
the builder's node syntax.

PdfPTableAbsoluteWidths:

Because setWidthPercentages is called with two arguments, we can't use
an attribute map to initialize via JavaBean properties.

PdfPTableCellHeights:

The original example reuses a PdfPCell object in different rows.
To follow that with PDFBuilder, we cannot use the builder's node management.
The PdfPTableCellHeights.groovy script follows the original example.
The PdfPTableCellHeights2.groovy script is a slight variation that uses
builder nodes but produces the same resulting document.

PdfPTableCellSpacing:

This example is even "worse" in reusing objects.  (They are reused for the
sake of the example, and don't represent a realistic real-life usage pattern.)

FoxDogGeneric1, FoxDogGeneric2:

Note use of closures for page events.
FoxDogGeneric2 is kind of silly.  It is supposed to illustrate how
useful the generic tag event is.  But it does this via a function.
The function could equally well tally the lines per speaker.  The
generic tag event just adds unnecessary complexity in this example.
