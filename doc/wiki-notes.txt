PDF-Builder:

1. Rationale for PDFBuilder
   - Make iText more concise
   - Make iText more Groovy
   - Remain compatible with iText

2. Creating Nodes
  paragraph() vs new Paragraph()
  attributes
  children
  "init" block

3. Special Properties
  document
  writer

4. Special Methods
  directContent.withContentByte() {} (rename?)
  directContent.withGraphics() {}

5. Closures for Page Events

Notes:
  - Have to be careful mixing variable names with node factory names, e.g. "cell".
    (See PdfPTableCompare for example.)
  - Note when using table() to heed the difference between text mode and composite mode
    (As explained in iText in Action, though it would be better if I had an example that showed the issues clearly.)
  - Note about having to use "as float".
  - Explain difference between cell(new Paragraph(...)) and cell() {paragraph(...)}
