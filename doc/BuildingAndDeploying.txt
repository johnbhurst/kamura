To build JAR:

  gradle jar

To deploy Ivy and Maven artifacts to skepticalhumorist.co.nz/artifactory (repo for alpha code):

  gradle uploadArchives

Note: You need to define properties in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties:
artifactory.publish.username = Artifactory publish user
artifactory.publish.password = Artifactory publish password

To deploy Ivy artifacts in local filesystem repo:

  gradle uploadDefault

Yes, I want to make these deployment tasks more intuitive.
