h1. pdf-builder

This is a Groovy PDF builder that uses the "iText library":http://itextpdf.com to generate PDF documents.

The project is inspired by the "groovy-pdf project":http://code.google.com/p/groovy-pdf/, but contains all new code.

Currently the code is under development, and still in a very much alpha state.
However, we are already using it for some projects under development at a client.

We hope to follow up soon with:
  * Documentation
  * Samples
  * More features
  * More tests
  * Maven artifacts
  * ... get rid of the debugging println()s ... ;-)
