kamura-groovy-xssf is a Groovy Excel builder and reader that uses the http://poi.apache.org[Apache POI library] for Excel 2007 documents.

The project began with link:http://skepticalhumorist.blogspot.co.nz/2010/12/groovy-dslbuilders-poi-spreadsheets.html[this blog post], and was influenced by improvements in link:https://blog.andresteingress.com/2012/01/13/gsheets-a-groovy-builder-based-on-apache-poi[this GSheets blog post].

Currently the code is under development, and still in a very much alpha state.
However, we are already using it for some projects under development at a client.

We hope to follow up soon with:

* Documentation
* Samples
* More features
* More tests
* Maven artifacts

Here's an example to read a workbook sheet using kamura-groovy-xssf:
