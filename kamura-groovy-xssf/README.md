# kamura-groovy-xssf

kamura-groovy-xssf is a Groovy Excel builder and reader that uses the [Apache POI library](http://poi.apache.org) for Excel 2007 documents.

The project began with [this blog post](http://skepticalhumorist.blogspot.co.nz/2010/12/groovy-dslbuilders-poi-spreadsheets.html), and was influenced by improvements in [this GSheets blog post](https://blog.andresteingress.com/2012/01/13/gsheets-a-groovy-builder-based-on-apache-poi).

Currently the code is under development, and still in a very much alpha state.
However, we are already using it for some projects under development at a client.

We hope to follow up soon with:

* Documentation
* Samples
* More features
* More tests
* Maven artifacts

Here's an example to read a workbook sheet using kamura-groovy-xssf:

``` groovy
// (TODO)
```
